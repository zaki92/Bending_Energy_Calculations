# Bending_Energy_Calculations

"""
These functions can be used to calculate the surface areas and bending energies 
of oblate spheroids, elliptic hyperboloids and combinations of oblate spheroids
and elliptic hyperboloids, as described in the publication 'A Biophysical 
Model for Plant Cell Plate Development' by Jawaid et al. Further explanations  
about how to use this codeare given in the functions.'
